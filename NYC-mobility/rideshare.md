# Constructing Human Mobility Tensor on NYC Rideshare Trip Data

Among a large number of open human mobility datasets, [TLC trip record data](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) might be one of the most classical sources for doing mobility research and data analysis. This open data includes yellow and green taxi trip records, For-Hire Vehicle (FHV) trip records, and High Volume For-Hire Vehicle (HVFHV) trip records stored in the `.parquet` format, ranging from 2009 to the latest date. The HVFHV trip records have TLC license numbers for Juno (`HV0002`), Uber (`HV0003`), Via (`HV0004`), and Lyft (`HV0005`), see [data dictionary](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_hvfhs.pdf) for details. In what follows, we use rideshare trip records to mention the HVFHV trip records instead.
