# Constructing Human Mobility Tensor on NYC Rideshare Trip Data

Among a large number of open human mobility datasets, [TLC trip record data](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) might be one of the most classical sources for doing mobility research and data analysis. The data includes yellow and green taxi trip records, For-Hire Vehicle (FHV) trip records, and High Volume For-Hire Vehicle (HVFHV) trip records, ranging from 2009 to the latest date.
