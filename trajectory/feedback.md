Couple of issues confused me:

- Data description is unclear
- Should rename data files
- Trajectory data itself

**Data description**

The data description is not readily available.

**Data file**

Too much data files for each day, e.g., 1024 files on October 1st. The naming system shows differences by the `part-xxxxx-tid...` (e.g., `xxxxx` as the number `00000`) and the `-xxxx-1-c000.snappy.parquet` (e.g., `xxxx` as the number `908` or `1931`). What is the difference among these data files?

**Trajectory data**
