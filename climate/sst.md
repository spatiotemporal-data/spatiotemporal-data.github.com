# Sea Surface Temperature Dataset

The oceans play an important role in the global climate system. Exploiting sea surface temperature allows one to sense the climate and understand the dynamical processes of energy exchange at the sea surface. [NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/sea-surface-temperature-optimum-interpolation/v2.1/access/avhrr/) provides a large amount of sea surface temperature data from September 1, 1981 to the present date.
