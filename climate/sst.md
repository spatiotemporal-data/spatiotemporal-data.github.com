# Sea Surface Temperature Dataset

The oceans play an important role in the global climate system. Exploiting sea surface temperature allows one to sense the climate and understand the dynamical processes of energy exchange at the sea surface. [NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/sea-surface-temperature-optimum-interpolation/v2.1/access/avhrr/) provides a large amount of sea surface temperature data from September 1, 1981 to the present date.

## Open Dataset

With the advent of satellite retrievals of sea surface temperature beginning in the early of 1980s, there are a large amount of high-resolution sea surface temperature data available for climate analysis, attracting a lot of attention. These data were interpolated through some statistical methods.
