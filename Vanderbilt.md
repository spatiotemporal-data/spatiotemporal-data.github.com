## Vanderbilt University

### [College of Connected Computing](http://click.interfolio.com/track/click/30087966/www.vanderbilt.edu?p=eyJzIjoiRXpha0FjcU91Rm9seEZWM2I4ZEI3UHNBZTI4IiwidiI6MSwicCI6IntcInVcIjozMDA4Nzk2NixcInZcIjoxLFwidXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3d3dy52YW5kZXJiaWx0LmVkdVxcXC9jaGFuY2VsbG9yXFxcL2luaXRpYXRpdmVzLWFuZC1vdXRyZWFjaFxcXC9ncm93dGhcXFwvY29ubmVjdGVkLWNvbXB1dGluZ1xcXC9cIixcImlkXCI6XCIyZmVhOWVjZTA3MGU0ZDczYTUxM2RjMjlmNzU1MzE1Y1wiLFwidXJsX2lkc1wiOltcIjczNDBjNTkwN2IyNTA2ZDUwNTBkNTQwNGE1OTdmNWM4YWJlNTNkYTdcIl19In0)

To provide more students with the skills and credentials needed in a society shaped by technology, Vanderbilt is establishing the College of Connected Computing, the university’s first new college in 40 years. The new, interdisciplinary college will advance breakthrough discoveries and strengthen computing education for every one of our students through a “computing for all” approach.

<br>

#### Establishing a New College

The College of Connected Computing’s teaching and research in AI, data science and other disciplines will advance those fields and support students and faculty in every one of Vanderbilt’s schools and colleges. Every student and faculty member will have the opportunity to develop fluency in today’s essential technology and to use it to excel in any area they are studying. 

A search for the college’s inaugural dean launched in fall 2024. We plan to enroll our first students in this college by the fall of 2026. 

<br>

#### Why is Vanderbilt creating the College of Connected Computing?

Of all the factors shaping society, few are more influential than the rapid emergence of advanced computing, AI and data science. To continue to carry out the university's mission, prepare all of Vanderbilt's students for their careers and advance research across the university, Vanderbilt must contribute even more to the study, understanding and innovative application of these fast-changing disciplines. The aim is to make Vanderbilt a global leader in these fields, ensuring the university's continued academic excellence and capacity for world-changing innovation.

<br>

#### How will the creation of this new college affect current students?

The creation of the College of Connected Computing will not negatively affect the requirements, time to completion, or quality of any major that is moved to the new college. Students currently enrolled in a major that ultimately becomes housed in the new school will have uninterrupted access to the same level of world-class faculty and opportunities within the major they have now. As we go through this exciting change, every decision is being informed by best practice with the intention of improving the educational experience for students. More specifics will be communicated as plans develop.

<br>

#### How will this new college connect to other areas of the university?

The new, interdisciplinary college will collaborate with all of Vanderbilt’s schools and colleges to advance discoveries and strengthen computing education through a “computing for all” approach.

<br>

#### What’s next for the College of Connected Computing?

A faculty task force, in collaboration with Vice Provost for Special Initiatives Duane Watson, the provost and the chancellor, is working to finalize the mission and core values of the new college. As next steps are solidified, updates will be provided regarding faculty, staff and student recruitment, as well as opportunities for collaboration and partnership with industry leaders. 

<br>

#### How can the Vanderbilt community get involved?

The College of Connected Computing will emphasize collaboration across all schools and colleges at Vanderbilt. Faculty, staff and students interested in contributing to or learning more about this initiative are encouraged to stay engaged as updates are shared through university communications and events. 

<br>

#### What programs will be offered in the College of Connected Computing?

The new dean and provost will decide the specific programs and degrees offered by the College of Connected Computing. The task force is providing suggested programs as part of its work back to Vice Provost for Special Initiatives Duane Watson, the provost and the chancellor. Their goal is to ensure the new college offers innovative and interdisciplinary programs in computer science, artificial intelligence, data science and related fields. The task force is working to identify programs that will meet the growing demand for technology-focused education and align with Vanderbilt’s strengths and commitment to interdisciplinary collaboration. Further details on the programs will be announced as the task force finalizes its recommendations.

Immersion Vanderbilt is a dynamic, two-part program for undergraduate students that merges academic excellence with real-world experiences, providing a platform for you to dive deeply into a field of interest and make a tangible impact.

#### Two-Part Program, Endless Possibilities

Immersion Vanderbilt is more than just an academic requirement for all undergraduate students–it’s an opportunity to tailor your educational journey to match your passions and career aspirations. This unique opportunity allows students to work closely with faculty mentors, tap into Vanderbilt’s extensive resources, and make a difference in their chosen field.

#### Immersive Experiences

The immersive experience component of Immersion Vanderbilt is designed to complement your academic journey with practical, engaging opportunities that will enrich your learning and prepare you for future success. Your immersive experience is your opportunity to explore, innovate, and connect with real-world challenges and opportunities. 

Immersive experiences offer you the chance to step beyond the classroom and engage deeply with your field of study. Students are encouraged to pursue multiple immersive experiences during their academic career.

Immersive experiences can be completed within or outside of your home school/college in a few different ways:

Part of a pre-approved program of study or tagged class 
Part of a Vanderbilt-approved study abroad program or part of a cohort run by Vanderbilt faculty and staff
Independent experience outside of other programs (i.e. an internship, research, independent international opportunity, or community/civic engagement work)

#### Culminating Projects

As the second half of Immersion Vanderbilt, the culminating project is simply what students create informed by their immersive experience(s). Immersion Vanderbilt culminating projects are as unique as the students who create them! 

Spring 2025 Graduates must submit their culminating projects by Monday, April 21, 2025. Faculty have until May 3 to mark Immersion Vanderbilt projects as complete. Every student must submit a culminating project submission form to complete Immersion Vanderbilt and it must be approved by a Vanderbilt faculty member.

Formats for Culminating Projects
Like immersive experiences, culminating projects can be completed as part of a pre-approved program of study, a tagged class, or as an independent project with support from an Immersion Vanderbilt faculty adviser.  Depending on the project, presenting at a showcase or fair may be required.

Projects can take many forms, including but not limited to:

- Presentation (e.g., conference, research fair, Immersion Vanderbilt showcase)
- Artwork, installation, or exhibit
- Media project (e.g., podcast, website, film, recording, etc.)
- Musical composition

### [FutureVU](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/futurevu/)

#### What is FutureVU?

FutureVU embodies the university’s core values and holistic approach to Vanderbilt’s teaching, research and service mission, including the advancement of the university’s land resources and human capital in support of the Academic Strategic Plan.

In 2015, FutureVU began as a comprehensive land use planning effort, with the goal of ensuring the Vanderbilt University campus is designed and prepared at every level to support its students, faculty and staff, and to uphold the university’s mission and values.

While academic and student residential building projects on campus are driven by the Academic Strategic Plan, and the academic and research mission of the university, the FutureVU land use plan provides a consistent strategy and guiding principles necessary for the realization of all capital projects and changes to the built environment.

More recently, FutureVU, the overarching campus planning process, was expanded to be a more holistic model, developing the spaces on campus and investing in the initiatives that support the people who live, work and learn in them.

#### A Framework for the Future

FutureVU provides a framework for the future of Vanderbilt, while considering core themes such as inclusion and accessibility, sustainability, transportation and mobility, connectivity and community enhancement, engagement with surrounding communities, and preservation of the historic park-like setting. These themes are guided by values that directly relate to Vanderbilt’s core mission of teaching, research and discovery.
