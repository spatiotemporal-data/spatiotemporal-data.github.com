# Foundation of Optimization

## I. Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers

Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is an optimization algorithm designed to solve a certain class of problems. It breaks the optimization problems down into smaller, and easier-to-solve subproblems, and in the meanwhile converges to a solution that satisfies both the primal and dual optimization problems. Basically, ADMM combines the ideas from dual decomposition and augmented Lagrangian methods, in which the dual decomposition splits the original optimization problem into two or more subproblems and augmented Lagrangian methods use an augmented Lagrangian function to handle constraints in the problem.
