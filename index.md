This project aims at supporting research for all aspects of spatiotemporal data modeling with machine learning and solving many scientific, mathematical, industrial, and engineering problems in:

- Urban Science
- Human Mobility Modeling
- Geospatial Data Analysis
- Intelligent & Sustainable Urban Systems
- Optimization & Decision Making
- Data Standardization & Valorization
- Signal Processing
- Network Science
- Social Learning
- Causal Inference
- Cyber-Physical Systems

This project presents some spatiotemporal methods with data-driven machine learning:

- **(Chen et al., 2024)** [Discovering dynamic patterns from spatiotemporal data with time-varying low-rank autoregression](https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2023.3294440). IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering. 36 (2): 504-517. [[Blog post](https://spatiotemporal-data.github.io/posts/time_varying_model/)]

To advance the development of spatiotemporal data modeling in the research community, this project handles various spatiotemporal data:

- [Analyzing millions of taxi trips in the City of Chicago](https://spatiotemporal-data.github.io/Chicago-mobility/taxi-data/)
- [Utilizing international import and export trade data from WTO Stats](https://spatiotemporal-data.github.io/trade/import-export/)

and provides a series of tutorials on visualizing spatiotemporal data in Python:

- [Global water vapor patterns](https://spatiotemporal-data.github.io/climate/water-vapor/)
- [Germany energy consumption](https://spatiotemporal-data.github.io/energy/E-usage-data/)
- Service-level mobile traffic data

For those who are interested in broad areas within the scope, we would like to recommend a series of [reading notes](https://spatiotemporal-data.github.io/bib/).
