# NSF Funding Information

**Opportunities**

[A list of all the programs](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/programs.jsp?org=IIS) within the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems (IIS).

- NSF 24-541: ACED: Accelerating Computing-Enabled Scientific Discovery (ACED) [[Program page](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/aced-accelerating-computing-enabled-scientific)] [[Guidelines](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/aced-accelerating-computing-enabled-scientific/nsf24-541/solicitation)]

The ACED program solicits proposals in two tracks:

**Track I: Emerging Ideas Proposals**: This track is intended to support speculative **multidisciplinary projects** that explore bold new research directions. The goal of these projects should be to obtain preliminary results, refine the overall research plan based on these results, and garner insights into whether these advances generalize beyond the targeted use case or domain. Projects are **limited to $500,000** in total budget, with durations of up to **18-24 months**. Proposals accepted in 2024 Deadline Date (**June 17 2024**).

The intent is to catalyze advancements on both sides of a virtuous cycle that:

- Benefit scientific disciplines through computational technologies.
- Foster novel computing technologies that will enable advances beyond the specific use cases or domains originally targeted.

Note:

- **Interdisciplinary collaborative** research:
  - One group is expected to consist of researchers in computing
  - The other group of researchers are expected to represent another scientific or engineering discipline
