In the past decades, machine learning has been an important data-driven computing paradigm for learning from data. However, real-world data usually demonstrate complicated data behaviors (e.g., uncertainty) or underlying patterns. In this study, we hope to connect machine learning with real-world data problems in transport demand modeling and in the meanwhile highlight the importance of uncertainty quantification in the prediction task. There are three critical challenges as proposed:

- Robustness: Solving the unexpected data variation that produced by special events or extreme cases.
- Reliability: Handling the the model's generalization ability to different conditions.
- Fairness: Reducing data/model biases over different groups of the collected dataset.
