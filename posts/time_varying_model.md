# Time-Varying Autoregression

#### Discovering Dynamic Patterns from Spatiotemporal Data with Time-Varying Low-Rank Autoregression

<br>

Dynamic mechanisms that drive nonlinear systems are universally complex. Straightforwardly, one can investigate the behavior of a system by discovering the interpretable dynamic patterns from real-world data. In practice, when we take observations from a real-world complex system, spatiotemporal data are one of the most widely encountered from relating to space and time and showing the characteristics of time series. Without loss of generality, leveraging time series models not only allows one to analyze spatiotemporal data but also makes it possible to discover inherent spatial and temporal patterns from the data over space and time.
